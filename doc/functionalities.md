# Functionalities

---

This plugin allows users to create multiple carts for their own use.

After adding products to the first cart and viewing it, logged-in user has the possibility to add a new cart.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/multicart_single.png"/>
</div>

After creating it, user can switch between and view the contents of all created carts.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/multicart_multiple.png"/>
</div>

It is also possible to switch between carts in every shop view using mini cart.
